Rich feature Circular SeekBar (Circle, Semi-circle, and Ellipse) for Android.

This library is based on [CircularSeekBar of Matt Joseph (devadvance)](https://github.com/devadvance/circularseekbar).
But the original author seems to have stopped maintaining (last commit was in 2016), so I decide to take it up by myself.

I made it build on Android Studio (Gradle), then fix & add more features to the library.

## The features I add

1. Support float progress, instead of integer only.
2. Refactor the name of the attributes, to avoid conflicts.
3. Disable the seek pointer, make it work like a circular progress bar.
4. Some other bug fixes for Matt's CircularSeekBar.
5. Customize the shape of progress end (butt, round, square)
6. Use a arc to represent the pointer, you can custom the arc angle.
7. Negative progress support.
8. Other small features.

## Setup

### Gradle
``` Gradle
dependencies {
    implementation 'me.tankery.lib:circularSeekBar:1.3.0'
}
```

### Source
Copy sources and `attrs.xml` in module `circularSeekBar` to your project.
